- **2)** The recurrence for work would be W(n) = W(n-1) + W(n-2) + O(1) since we do constant work alongside the recursive calls of (n-1) and (n-2), which comes out to W(n) = O(2^n)

- **3)** The recurrence for span would be S(n) = S(n-1) + O(1) since it is not parallel, which comes out to S(n) = O(n)

- **4)**

- **6)**

- **8)**
